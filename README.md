Twitter is one of the biggest social media platform in Today’s world.It generates a huge  amount of data in the form of tweets for every second.These data contains useful  information but processing such a huge amount of data will be difficult. The difficulty can  be overcome by using Apache’s Hadoop Ecosystem. The tweets can be collected using  flume. This data is then stored in HDFS and later can be processed using Hadoop and Hive  tools. Hadoop brings the advantage of cluster computing which can be useful in processing  the Big data.
